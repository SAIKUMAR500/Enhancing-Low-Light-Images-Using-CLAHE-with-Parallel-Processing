# Enhancing-Low-Light-Images-Using-CLAHE-with-Parallel-Processing


1. Introduction
Low-light images are common in various domains, such as photography, surveillance, and medical imaging. However, poor lighting often results in images with low contrast and hidden details. Enhancing these images is critical for improving visibility and extracting valuable information.

This project introduces a method to enhance low-light images using CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) and optimize processing for multiple images simultaneously through parallel processing. This approach combines efficiency and scalability with high-quality visual output.

2. Goals of the Project
The primary objectives of the project are:

Contrast Enhancement: Use CLAHE to enhance low-light images without amplifying noise.
Parallel Processing: Leverage multi-threading to process multiple images simultaneously.
Visualization: Display the original and enhanced images side by side for easy comparison.
Optimization: Ensure the solution is scalable and efficient for large datasets.

5. Key Concepts
A. CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
CLAHE is a sophisticated image enhancement technique that:

Improves contrast by working on the Luminance (L) channel in the LAB color space.
Enhances local regions by applying adaptive histogram equalization.
Prevents noise amplification using a clip limit.
B. Parallel Processing
Processing multiple images simultaneously:

Uses Pythonâ€™s ThreadPoolExecutor to spawn threads for parallel execution.
Significantly reduces processing time, making the solution efficient for large datasets.
C. Visualization
The enhanced images are displayed side by side with their original counterparts, making it easy to compare and analyze the results.

5. Workflow Overview
The following steps outline the workflow for the project:

Input: Provide a list of low-light images for enhancement.
Enhancement:
Convert each image to LAB color space.
Apply CLAHE to the Luminance (L) channel to enhance contrast.
Convert the image back to BGR format for visualization.
Parallel Processing: Process multiple images concurrently using ThreadPoolExecutor.
Visualization: Display the original and enhanced images side by side.


7. Results
The project produces enhanced versions of low-light images with noticeable improvements in visibility and detail. Below is an example of the output:

Original Image	Enhanced Image
Observations:
Enhanced images show better contrast and improved visibility.
Details in darker areas become more apparent without introducing noise.
The process works efficiently for multiple images.

Autonomous Vehicles: Enabling clearer vision in low-light or foggy conditions.

Underwater Imaging: Improving visibility in dim underwater environments.

10. Future Enhancements
11. 
While this project provides a robust foundation for low-light image enhancement, the following improvements can be made:

Batch Uploading:
Allow users to upload and process entire folders of images.
Automatic Saving:
Save enhanced images to a designated output directory.
GUI Integration:
Build a user-friendly interface using frameworks like Tkinter or PyQT.
Real-Time Enhancement:
Apply enhancements to live video feeds from a webcam.
Integration with Advanced Methods:
Incorporate GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) for even more realistic results.

11. Conclusion
This project successfully enhances low-light images using CLAHE, combining simplicity and effectiveness. The integration of parallel processing ensures that the solution is both efficient and scalable. By visualizing the results side by side, users can easily compare and analyze the improvements.

This approach lays the groundwork for more advanced techniques, such as integrating machine learning models or applying real-time enhancements. With its flexibility and efficiency, this solution can be adapted for numerous practical applications across different domains.
